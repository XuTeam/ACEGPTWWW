Large language models are crucial in natural language processing, adept at comprehending and generating human language through deep learning and extensive training. They excel in machine translation, text summarization, and dialogue systems, offering versatile applications. By learning from vast language data, these models capture linguistic complexity and context, resulting in accurate and fluent text generation, advancing artificial intelligence significantly. However, their adoption among Arabic-speaking populations remains limited. The uniqueness and complexity of the Arabic language present ongoing challenges, necessitating continuous development and optimization of Arabic models. In response to OpenAI's sanctions, the need to develop an Arabic-based system akin to ChatGPT arises.Training models capable of comprehending and generating multiple languages offers various advantages. Multilingual models efficiently handle mixed textual data, enhancing comprehension and generation capabilities. Beyond its scientific value, this project holds significant political importance as it fosters collaboration among countries participating in the "Belt and Road" initiative, overcoming the blockade faced by Saudi Arabia from US-based OpenAI. Collaborative training of ChatGPT can break this barrier and strengthen cooperation. Moreover, large models like ChatGPT drive production values worth billions of dollars, aiming to further improve efficiency across various domains.
